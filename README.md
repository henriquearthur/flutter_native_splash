Automatically generates native code for adding splash screens in Android and iOS. Customize with specific platform, background color and splash image.

This package is heavily inspired by [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons) created by [Mark O'Sullivan](https://github.com/MarkOSullivan94) and [Franz Silva](https://github.com/franzsilva).

## Usage
First, add `flutter_native_splash` as a [dev dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash#-installing-tab-). You should add the package to `dev_dependencies` because you don't need this plugin in your APK.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_native_splash: ^0.2.0
```

Don't forget to `flutter pub get`.

### 1. Setting the splash screen
Add your settings to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file or create a file in your root project folder named `flutter_native_splash.yaml` with your settings.

```yaml
flutter_native_splash:
  image: assets/images/splash.png
  color: "42a5f5"
  image_dark: assets/images/splash-invert.png
  color_dark: "042a49"
```

* Images must be `png` files.
* You can use `#` in color parameters as well. `color: "#42a5f5"`

You can omit `image_dark` and `color_dark` if you want a single splash screen regardless of dark mode:
```yaml
flutter_native_splash:
  image: assets/images/splash.png
  color: "42a5f5"
```

You can omit `image` and/or the `image_dark` parameter if you just want a colored splash screens:
```yaml
flutter_native_splash:
  color: "42a5f5"
  color_dark: "042a49"
```

You can also set `android` or `ios` to `false` if you don't want to create a splash screen for a specific platform.
```yaml
flutter_native_splash:
  image: assets/images/splash.png
  color: "42a5f5"
  android: false
```

In case your image should use all available screen (width and height) you can use `fill` property.
```yaml
flutter_native_splash:
  image: assets/images/splash.png
  color: "42a5f5"
  fill: true
```
*Note: `fill` property is not yet implemented for iOS splash screens.*

If you want to disable full screen splash screen on Android you can use `android_disable_fullscreen` property.
```yaml
flutter_native_splash:
  image: assets/images/splash.png
  color: "42a5f5"
  android_disable_fullscreen: true
```

### 2. Run the package
After adding your settings, run the package with

```
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

When the package finishes running your splash screen is ready.

## Notes
* If splash screen was not updated properly on iOS or if you experience a white screen before splash screen, run `flutter clean` and recompile your app. (issue [#9](https://github.com/henriquearthur/flutter_native_splash/issues/9))
* This package modifies `launch_background.xml`, `styles.xml` and `MainActivity` files on Android and `LaunchScreen.storyboard`, `Info.plist` and `AppDelegate` on iOS. If you modified this files manually this plugin may not work properly, please [open an issue](https://github.com/henriquearthur/flutter_native_splash/issues/new) if you find any bugs.

## Recommendations
* If you want to use a Material Icon as your splash image, download an icon in [(material.io/resources/icons)](https://material.io/resources/icons/) as **PNG** for **Android**. I recommend using the biggest icon in `drawable-xxxhdpi` folder which was just downloaded for better results.
* Material Colors are available in [material.io/resources/color](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/)

## How it works
### Android
* Your splash image will be resized to `mdpi`, `hdpi`, `xhdpi`, `xxhdpi` and `xxxhdpi` drawables.
* An `<item>` tag containing a `<bitmap>` for your splash image drawable will be added in `launch_background.xml`
* Background color will be added in `colors.xml` and referenced in `launch_background.xml`.
* Code for full screen mode toggle will be added in `styles.xml` and `MainActivity`.
* Dark mode variants are placed in `drawable-night`, `values-night`, etc. resource folders.

### iOS
* Your splash image will be resized to `@3x` and `@2x` images.
* Color and image properties will be inserted in `LaunchScreen.storyboard`.
* The background color is implemented by using a single pixel png file and stretching it to fit the screen.
* Code for hidden status bar toggle will be added in `Info.plist` and `AppDelegate`.
